<p>This website is where I store some of the work that I've been working on both in Python and in R. While some of these projects are assignments given for school, other projects were conducted outside of school as extracurricular points of interest. Other pieces of code may be simplistic but will serve to show what can be done with these tools with a few lines of simple and straight forward code (i.e. insightful and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations).</p>

<p>Please note: I will continuously be working on providing README files whenever possible. If there's none available at the moment for the project you're looking at, please let me know if you have any questions or would like something explained. Otherwise, I hope to have all projects explained as soon as possible.</p>

<a id="clustering-analysis" class="anchor" href="#clustering-analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clustering Analysis</h3>

<p>In this project, I was given 50 different data sets each containing close to 800 data points. Each data set represented a "road" or a "train track" or a "field" or anything that can come in between two antenna points. The data points found in each data set were the time in seconds it took to get from one antenna to the other antenna. The task was to use Clustering Techniques to identify which of the 25 data sets represented a road.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the data can not be made available at this point as it is proprietary.</p>

<a id="credit-scoring" class="anchor" href="#credit-scoring" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Credit Scoring</h3>

<p>This assignment uses the fairly infamous German Credit Scoring Data Set which classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. The objective is to create a model than can predict if someone will be a good or bad credit risk.</p>

<a id="loess-example" class="anchor" href="#loess-example" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Loess Example</h3>

<p>In this short assignment, we took a look at how the Loess method worked when graphing data. Data was scraped from the Wikipedia page of the historical winner times. The times for men and women were compared. Without the Loess method, the chart could be interpreted incorrectly in that female times could be faster than male times, but with this method, the true result becomes clearer.</p>

<a id="linear-regression-modeling" class="anchor" href="#linear-regression-modeling" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Linear Regression Modeling</h3>

<p>In this Linear Regression model, our group wanted to see if there was a relationship between the number of days needed to perform a clinical trial and various independent variables that surround data entry performance (i.e. if poor or missing fields and incorrect entries resulted in longer clinical trials). While not a standard linear regression study, the output of our attempt resulted in some interesting data visualizations during the data exploration piece. Although the resulting R-squared was humourously low and the model diagnostics were violated at every turn, this does set a good example of the method to implement linear regression and what needs to be taken into consideration when doing so.</p>

<p>Once again, the data is proprietary and is not able to be shared.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
