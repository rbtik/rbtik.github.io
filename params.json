{"name":"rbtik.github.io","tagline":"","body":"#Welcome to my GitHub repository!\r\nThis website is where I store some of the work that I've been working on both in Python and in R. While some of these projects are assignments given for school, other projects were conducted outside of school as extracurricular points of interest. Other pieces of code may be simplistic but will serve to show what can be done with these tools with a few lines of simple and straight forward code (i.e. insightful and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations).\r\n\r\nPlease note: I will continuously be working on providing README files whenever possible. If there's none available at the moment for the project you're looking at, please let me know if you have any questions or would like something explained. Otherwise, I hope to have all projects explained as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n### Loess Example\r\nIn this short assignment, we took a look at how the Loess method worked when graphing data. Data was scraped from the Wikipedia page of the historical winner times. The times for men and women were compared. Without the Loess method, the chart could be interpreted incorrectly in that female times could be faster than male times, but with this method, the true result becomes clearer.\r\n\r\n[Boston Marathon - Loess Example](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rbtik/1415-Projects/blob/gh-pages/Boston%20Marathon/Boston_Marathon_Loess.html) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Clustering Analysis\r\nIn this project, I was given 50 different data sets each containing close to 800 data points. Each data set represented a \"road\" or a \"train track\" or a \"field\" or anything that can come in between two antenna points. The data points found in each data set were the time in seconds it took to get from one antenna to the other antenna. The task was to use Clustering Techniques to identify which of the 25 data sets represented a road.\r\n\r\n[Road Clustering](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rbtik/1415-Projects/blob/gh-pages/Clustering%20Example/Road%20Clustering.ipynb)\r\n[README](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rbtik/1415-Projects/blob/gh-pages/Clustering%20Example/README.txt)\r\n\r\n### Credit Scoring\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
